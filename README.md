## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

In this solo project I learnt how Javascript deals with strings and numbers to modify the HTML text.
As [Per Harald Borgen](https://github.com/perborgen) said: "Strings always win against numbers" ðŸ¥‡

```js
// modify paragraph with updated conversions
lengthConversion.textContent =
  input +
  " meters = " +
  resultMetersToFeet +
  " feet | " +
  input +
  " feet = " +
  resultFeetToMeters +
  " meters ";
```

### Continued development

I'd like to implement a way to choose the number to convert directly in the HTML.
